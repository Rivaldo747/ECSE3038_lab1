voltage divider() 
the function calculates the total resistance , summing the elements of the specific list of resistors, the potential divider formula is then implemented to calculate the voltage drop across the resistors
temperature check()
 this function checks the whether the patient is hypothermic, hyperthermic or has a normal body temperature. these are noted using specific conditions intialized whether degree celcius or degree farenheit. 
 parallel()
 this function is used to calculate a list of resistors in parallel using parameters decided by the user. 

 The purpose of conducting these codes were to enhace my thinking capability and to also become more familiar with using python along with github.

 joke :
when you try to define constants 
*python enters chat*
"we dont do that here" ....Lol
